                Above and Beyond implements ideas for an urban utopia, farfetched thoughts about a city that has been turned on its head, in which rooftops become the stuff of fantasies, a playground for celestial spirits and demons. The project invites the observer to leave the street behind and to open a door to spaces in the city that are usually kept under lock and key, and to explore a series of rooftops, each of which will host a different artwork.
 <br><br>
                The rooftop city is a neglected city, which in present-day Jerusalem plays a purely structural role. Even going up to the roof requires effort and commitment: climbing endless stairs and making your way through neglected and abandoned territory. But the roof makes a reciprocal commitment—it pledges its soul to the city. A city whose history pulls you down, to the depths of the earth, but whose rooftops open up a heavenly space, offer a different perspective and a chance to experiment with new methods of observing reality.
 <br><br>
                
                The creative process behind this project is based on self-styled, urban research that seeks out living spaces that have slipped past the city’s collective consciousness. An indefatigable search, by-foot, comprising knocking on doors, gaining entry to buildings, requesting to see the roof, looking for non-existent keys, climbing long staircases, walking through neglect and dirt, and opening a creaky, rusty door until finally reaching your destination. The roof.
 <br><br>
                 
                Innocuous, grey buildings reveal alternative living spaces and stunning observation points. Rooftops that allow you to see the city from above, to view it as a whole and to imagine, against the backdrop of open sky, an untamed and inspirational super-city. The artists that joined this exploratory process, contemplate the city through sounds, materials, and images, breathe new life into it, and create experiences that the crowded city below finds it difficult to provide.
 <br><br>
                 
                But it turned out to be not so simple. One after the other, after months of negotiating with security guards, managers and landlords, questions crept in about ownership, perceptions, dangers and fears. One refusal after the other led us back to neighboring streets and exposed us to new roofs—neglected pieces of history that present themselves as dusty archives. We gradually realized that despite its mere presence, the roof was not going to surrender easily, it was not yet carved into the urban consciousness.  
 <br><br>
                 
                Jerusalem’s urban consciousness is a divided consciousness. East and west is not just a contentious political issue, it is also the source and basis for two world outlooks, two opposing municipal cultures. Whereas the roofs in "new," "advanced" West Jerusalem are generally ignored, the roofs of "old" East Jerusalem continue ancient rooftop traditions: releasing pigeons, building huts, drying laundry or food, raising animals, resting, sleeping or hosting on hot summer nights. From within this complex relationship between the two sides of the city, Above and Beyond tries to observe and learn, to shift its gaze to the eastern part of the city, to relate to it as a source of local inspiration—a  unique urban model that has been crafted and designed over thousands of years.   
 <br><br>
                 
                We are delighted and excited to invite you to join us on a journey that winds its way through new living spaces, to take part in the creation of a new urban functionality, and to discover, with us, a wild roof city.

            <p class='body-text'>
                    Five ancient, huge beasts sprawled on the roof of a building like relics from a prehistoric age, whose thunderous, raging and tremulous sounds resonate from the body of the pianos. This musical family creates a savannah of notes that play off one another in a desperate attempt to find a meeting point, despite the fact that it is in constant motion and thus perpetually escapes them.  Visitors are invited to explore the work through their bodies, seated or lying down, to touch the raging beasts and to feel the vibrations with all their senses, to contemplate in the space between what the eye perceives and the ear picks up, to hear through the gut. 
                    Root 2 was created as a response to the Western approach to music, which is based on mathematical principles that compare sounds but blur the deeper meaning behind a sound’s specific pitch. Thus, the Well-Tempered Clavier, with its 88 keys can be anything it wants. Using this capacity for camouflage, Maya Dunietz created the mammoth family out of broken, destroyed pianos that are given new life as a hybrid of new and old technology. 
                    This complex sound work explores the universe of rhythms and creates a sonic landscape of psycho-acoustic phenomena, which reveal the voices between sounds, voices that are constantly present but usually escape our senses.

            <p class='body-text'>
           A red circle is marked on a map at the center of which is the Temple Mount—at the heart of an historical, political and religious conflict zone. A no-fly zone (NFZ), which overlooks the Old City, approximately a 1.5km radius, which is classified by the Israel Airport Authority as LLP11, a NFZ, the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is forbidden for any type of plane to fly over this area at any height. The coordinates of the NFZ have been programmed into the drone and prevent it from taking off when it is in this area. 

Jerusalem is surrounded by walls, and not just the ones that are made out bricks and mortar. There are also technological walls that control and determine what can or cannot be seen in the city through a system of celestial permits. By using a drone that tests the boundaries of the NFZ, this work maps out and sketches the NFZ as it appears from the ground, as an integral part of the city’s daily reality and through earthly and spiritual pathways in East and West Jerusalem. The work attempt to make this elusive, invisible and political technology that controls and shapes our perception of space, visible. The NFZ can now be seen, discussed, questioned, opposed or subjected to a more detailed scrutiny, which reveals its cracks and facilitates broader understanding.

                An audio-visual tour (with headphones), performance duration…

                In the historical Bikur Cholim hospital complex, 16 babies, on average, draw their first breath every day. A 20-minute, participatory, audio tour with headphones on the roof of a unique building in the middle of a central thoroughfare. For what do we need to apologize to the babies who are being born into the current Jerusalem-Israeli reality, next to the most crowded and culturally diverse junction in the city? For what do we need to forgive ourselves and our immediate surroundings in this rare moment of spiritual elevation? 
                
                Ascending to the roof allows us, at least momentarily, to transcend our daily reality, to breathe, to expand our horizons and to see the bigger picture. The requests for forgiveness that are whispered into the ear of the listener are peppered with historical details about the venue and private musings and thoughts about the choices we make that dictate the reality into which we bring new life.

            <p class='body-text'>
                Above street level and beyond urban consciousness is the realm of the roofs—the ultimate periphery, neglected, operative platforms and dangerous spaces that are beyond the reach of the law. 

                A collection of machines stand on the roof, spit out raw building materials and carve out an eco-industrial living space--an evolving plane for a new existential infrastructure. The mechanical orchestra serves as a choir in an architectural setting—tar, sand, water and limestone are pumped out in a defiant show of recklessness and an endless attempt to expand and develop. 
                
                In this embryonic-industrial space the creative process is reversed—the building’s foundations come apart, the machine loses control, the raw materials are expelled, and an  industrial domain invites participants to observe the accumulating layers of construction, a mechanical organism that is in the process of creating the archeology of creation.

                Three profound monologues enable you to close your eyes and pass through walls, to gain insight into the Saint Louis French Hospital, a hospice for terminally ill patients, through the testimonies of the hospital staff, which is right here on the other side of the street. 

                A place in which death is a part of life, where there is no choice but to look it in the eye. Three care takers in the hospital, who have been working there for many years, talk candidly about life and death, about the end, fear, separation and reconciliation, what there is and what there isn’t, the thin line between heaven and earth, and spiritual awakenings.

There no camels in Beit lechem. There is a wall. 20 min drive from it is my parents house, in its garden, an olive tree. more than 100 years old.
This space is not mine, to stay in. There were many before. And the ones coming are already here, checking the light for placing there plants. These artifacts are yours. For others to marvel. Safe and stored, reminders of the days when art was spiritually charged. How it must feel, to create a work crafted so fine, that people can’t resist but touch it ? And they do it with such passion that it polishes the stone abstracting its form.

                The topography of the city likens the roofs of buildings to natural mountain peaks—high points on the horizon through which signals can be sent into the distance.  An observation point on the roof reveals a neon bonfire, a digital beacon, a contemporary interpretation of past communication: a declaration of war, announcing a new moon or a cry for help, were conveyed through an agreed code, a means of communication between groups that were distant from one another but shared the same fate. The neon bonfire translates the chaotic movement of the fire into computer code and thus breathes new digital life into an ancient urban ceremony.
